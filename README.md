# .Net with IdentityServer4

ASP.Net with IdentityServer4 is a learning-focused project built with **ASP.NET Core** that demonstrates how to secure a **Web API** using **IdentityServer4** and how a **Web application** can authenticate and consume that API.

This project was created to better understand **authentication**, **authorization**, and **token-based security** in a multi-project ASP.NET Core environment.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This solution contains **two main projects**:

### 1. ASP.NET Core Web Application
- Acts as the **client application**
- Will authenticate users using **IdentityServer4**
- Consumes secured endpoints from the Web API

  Repo URL: https://github.com/Sumbal-Ayaz/MultiTenantsWeb

### 2. ASP.NET Core Web API
- Secured using **IdentityServer4**
- Uses **NSwag** for API documentation and client generation
- Uses **ReDoc** for clean API documentation UI
