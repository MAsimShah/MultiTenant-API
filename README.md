# MultiTenant

MultiTenant is a learning-focused solution built with **ASP.NET Core** that demonstrates how to secure a **Web API** using **IdentityServer4** and how a **Web application** can consume that API.

The main goal of this project is to **learn and understand IdentityServer4**, authentication, authorization, and how these concepts work in a multi-project ASP.NET Core setup.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This solution contains **two main projects**:

### 1. ASP.NET Core Web Application
- Acts as the **client application**
- Will authenticate users using **IdentityServer4**
- Consumes secured endpoints from the Web API

### 2. ASP.NET Core Web API
- Secured using **IdentityServer4**
- Uses **NSwag** for API documentation and client generation
- Uses **ReDoc** for clean API documentation UI

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

- Understand **OAuth 2.0** and **OpenID Connect**
- Learn how **IdentityServer4** works
- Secure APIs using **access tokens**
- Configure clients, scopes, and resources
- Connect an ASP.NET Core Web App to a secured Web API
- Explore multi-project authentication architecture
